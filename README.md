This is the tenth project from Hacking With Swift [100 days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100) course.

## 💁🏽‍♂️ Overview

It's an app that allows saving a person picture and its name

## ⚙️ How it works

The user can take a picture or input one from their library
to create a contact. Then they can give it a name or delete.

I also added an option to share the person information, this
was not include on the course project and its challeges.
